-   My experience: I tried coding with not plan ahead and it was so difficult. Hence, I ended up going to the beggining and made some plans before coding.

-   Well, this was a nice one to play with, It was a good practice to use `useReducer` and react hooks. Things that I learned during this project were useing useReducer and useContext, those are really the big topics that I really got stronger after doing this project.

-   One thing I think is a wisdom that I would like to share is : it is very crucial to have a general idea about what the app is doing and start to break big problems to smaller once before diving into coding. No matter how tough it is, break the big problems down into as small parts as possible before tackling them. If you have a good base the likelyhood of having a good end is very heigh. Cheers.

## Description

The main purpose of this app is for practicing react (react hooks). It was designed for front-end developers to boost their knowledge and their tool belt for their future work. One big part of this exercise also was getting familliar with using useReducer and react  context.
